### Goal

This program is perfect for school projects and short articles. 
The simple user interface lets you copy urls from the internet as you go and just focus on your writing. Not thinking about how to reference and what information you need from the site. 

The program does not rely on any database but tries to figure out all the information by scraping the website you put in. I does not store your citations in some cloud service, it is all there on your computer. 

The program features rich text copy and paste to put your citations in any text editor without any extra plugins.

This program is not for large scale projects where you also need to manage text passages, and want to use the system to manage your thoughts. For this use case Mendeley, RefWorks or Zotero would be a better choice.
