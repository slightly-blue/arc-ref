# Arc Ref

A small reference and citation software built with electron, bootstrapped with create-react-app and material UI. 

This program is intended as an aid for school projects and short articles. 
The simple user interface lets you copy urls from the internet as you go and just focus on your writing. Not thinking about how to reference and what information you need from the site. 

The program does not rely on any database but tries to figure out all the information by scraping the website you put in. I does not store your citations in some cloud service, it is all there on your computer. 

The program features rich text copy and paste to put your citations in any text editor without any extra plugins.

This program is not for large scale projects where you also need to manage text passages, and want to use the system to manage your thoughts. For this use case Mendeley, RefWorks or Zotero would be a better choice.  



## Documentation 

redux stores the state of the entire app and occasionally writes it to file.
`types_of_work.js` is where all formatting takes place related to different types of work.
the backend handles formatting of individual items to allow the user to correct it afterward. 





## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
